# Utility Classes

Sefirot comes with few utility CSS classes. Most of the time, there should be a Vue Component that applies these classes, so prefere using them over directly using the CSS classes.

All Sefirot utility classes are prefixed with `u-`.

## Whitespace

### `u-nowrap` <Badge text="3.3.0" />

```css
.u-nowrap {
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```
