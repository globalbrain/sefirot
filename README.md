Sefirot is a collection of Vue Components for Global Brain Design System. Components are meant to be clean, sophisticated, and scalable.

Sefirot is focused on being used within Global Brain's ecosystem. Hence, the design—UI/UX—of components is relatively fixed, and customization capability is limited. In exchange for customizability, we can create components that are more robust, dynamic, and clean.

Feel free to leverage any component within this project. You may customize components how you see fit, and perhaps some features may be valuable to you. Any suggestions, requests, or questions are welcome.
